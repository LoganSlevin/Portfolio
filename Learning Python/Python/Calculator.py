p=int(input("what is the value of p???")) # asks you to place an input number for "p"
p=p**56 # the value is given a calculation in this case p**56 meaning "p" to the power of 56
print(p) # telling the programme to print the modified "p"

# There are different symbols for different equations, EG ** = power, * = Multiply, + = add, - = subtract, % remainder , / = Divide, "=" = The Answer
